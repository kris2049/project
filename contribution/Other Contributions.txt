Except for the code programming related to the project functions, "board.fxml" is co-written by us, in which "Rank", the leaderboard and the path display are done by Ziyuan Ning, and the rest of the code is written by Jingzhi and Zhou; "title.fxml" is written by Ning. Zhou writes the "name.fxml", and Ning writes the "resources", and Ning writes the code for the three txt files in resources because they all serve the functions written by Ning. Zhou wrote the JavaDoc and Ning wrote the README.txt.
